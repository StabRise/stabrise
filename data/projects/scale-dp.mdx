# Welcome to the ScaleDP library

ScaleDP is library allows you to process documents using AI/ML capabilities and scale it using Apache Spark.

**LLM** (Large Language Models) and **VLM** (Vision Language Models) models are used to extract data from text and images in combination with **OCR** engines. Discover
pretrained models for your projects or play with the thousands of models hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/)

## Key features

 - ✅ Loading **PDF** documents/**Images** to the Spark DataFrame (using [Spark PDF DataSource](https://stabrise.com/spark-pdf/)  and as `binaryFile`)
 - ✅ Extraction text/images from **PDF** documents/Images
 - ✅ Zero-Shot extraction **structured data** from Text/Images/Pdf's using LLM and ML models
 - ✅ Possibility run as **REST API** service without Spark Session for have minimum processing latency
 - ✅ Support **Streaming** mode for processing documents in real-time and integrate to event based architecture

# Quick Start

## Installation

Prerequisites:
 - **Python** 3.10 or higher

In case to run with Spark:

 - **Apache Spark** 3.5 or higher
 - **Java** 8

Install the `ScaleDP` package with pip. Python package on pypi is scaledp:
```shell
pip install scaledp
```

## Start a Spark session with ScaleDP

```python
from scaledp import *
spark = ScaleDPSession(with_spark_pdf=True)
spark
```

## Read PDF file to the DataFrame

```python
pdf_example = files('resources/pdfs/Invoice.pdf')

df = spark.read.format("pdf") \
    .load(pdf_example)

df.show()
```
