## ScaleDP: Streamlined Document Processing with AI and Apache Spark

**ScaleDP** is an open-source library designed to simplify extracting structured data from unstructured documents using cutting-edge **AI models**. By leveraging the power of **Apache Spark**, ScaleDP provides **scalable, high-performance document processing** for tasks such as invoice extraction, scanned document processing, and real-time pipeline integration.

### AI-Powered Document Processing

ScaleDP combines advanced **pre-trained models** like **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Vision Language Models (VLMs)**, and **OCR engines** to offer accurate and efficient data extraction from a variety of document types, including **PDFs** and **images**.

### Scalable and High-Performance Processing

With its foundation built on **Apache Spark**, ScaleDP is capable of handling large-scale document processing. Whether you're working with thousands of invoices or need to process documents in real-time, ScaleDP scales effortlessly to meet your needs.

---

## Key Features

- **Load PDFs and Images into Spark DataFrames**:
Use the built-in [**Spark PDF DataSource**](/spark-pdf) or load files as `binaryFile` for flexible document handling.

- **Extract Text and Images**:
Extract text and images from **PDFs** and **image** files for further processing.

- **Zero-Shot Data Extraction**:
Use pre-trained **LLMs** and **VLMs** to extract structured data from text, images, and PDFs without custom training.

- **REST API Support**:
Run **ScaleDP** as a lightweight **REST API** for low-latency processing, even without a Spark session.

- **Streaming Mode**:
Process documents in real-time and integrate with event-driven architectures.

- **Hugging Face Integration**:
Access thousands of pre-trained models from the **Hugging Face Hub** or use your own custom models.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- `Python` 3.10 or higher

In case to run with `Spark`:

- `Apache Spark` 3.5 or higher
- `Java` 8


Install the `ScaleDP` package with pip. Python package on pypi is scaledp:

```bash
pip install scaledp
```

### Start a Spark session with ScaleDP

To begin using **ScaleDP**, start a **Spark session** with the following code:

```python
from scaledp import *
spark = ScaleDPSession(with_spark_pdf=True)
spark
```

This initializes a **Spark** session with **Spark PDF** data source enabled.

### Load a PDF File

Once your Spark session is ready, you can load a PDF file into a Spark DataFrame:

```python
pdf_example = files('resources/pdfs/Invoice.pdf')

df = spark.read.format("pdf") \
    .load(pdf_example)

df.show_image()
```
---

Output:

![Invoice Document](/static/images/blog/scaledp/invoice.png)


### Zero-Shot data Extraction from the Image

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json

class Items(BaseModel):
    date: str
    item: str
    note: str
    debit: str

class InvoiceSchema(BaseModel):
    hospital: str
    tax_id: str
    address: str
    email: str
    phone: str
    items: list[Items]
    total: str


pipeline = PipelineModel(stages=[
    DataToImage(
        inputCol="content",
        outputCol="image"
    ),
    LLMVisualExtractor(
        inputCol="image",
        outputCol="invoice",
        model="gemini-1.5-flash",
        apiKey="",
        apiBase="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/",
        schema=json.dumps(InvoiceSchema.model_json_schema())
    )
])

result = pipeline.transform(df).cache()
```

Show the extracted json:

```python
result.show_json("invoice")
```
