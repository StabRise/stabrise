ScaleDP is an open-source library designed to simplify document processing
using AI models while leveraging the scalability of Apache Spark. It enables
developers to extract structured data from unstructured documents (PDFs,
images, etc.) using pre-trained models like LLMs (Large Language Models)
and VLMs (Vision Language Models), combined with OCR engines.

Whether you're processing invoices, extracting data from scanned documents, or
building real-time pipelines, ScaleDP provides the tools to handle it efficiently
and at scale.

## Key Features

- **Load PDFs and Images into Spark DataFrames**:
Use the built-in Spark PDF DataSource or load files as `binaryFile` for flexible document handling.

- **Extract Text and Images**:
Extract text and images from PDFs and image files for further processing.

- **Zero-Shot Data Extraction**:
Use pre-trained LLMs and VLMs to extract structured data from text, images, and PDFs without custom training.

- **REST API Support**:
Run ScaleDP as a lightweight REST API for low-latency processing, even without a Spark session.

- **Streaming Mode**:
Process documents in real-time and integrate with event-driven architectures.

- **Hugging Face Integration**:
Access thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub or use your own custom models.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Prerequisites:**

- `Python` 3.10 or higher

In case to run with `Spark`:

- `Apache Spark` 3.5 or higher
- `Java` 8


Install the `ScaleDP` package with pip. Python package on pypi is scaledp:

```bash
pip install scaledp
```

### Start a Spark session with ScaleDP

To begin using ScaleDP, start a Spark session with the following code:

```python
from scaledp import *
spark = ScaleDPSession(with_spark_pdf=True)
spark
```

This initializes a Spark session with ScaleDP's PDF processing capabilities enabled.

### Load a PDF File

Once your Spark session is ready, you can load a PDF file into a Spark DataFrame:

```python
pdf_example = files('resources/pdfs/Invoice.pdf')

df = spark.read.format("pdf") \
    .load(pdf_example)

df.show()
```
