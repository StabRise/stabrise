This blog post introduces Spark PDF, a custom data source for Apache Spark that empowers users to seamlessly integrate PDF data into their Spark workflows.

**Source Code**: [https://github.com/StabRise/spark-pdf](https://github.com/StabRise/spark-pdf)

**Quick Start Jupyter Notebook Spark 3.x.x**: [PdfDataSource.ipynb](https://github.com/StabRise/spark-pdf/blob/main/examples/PdfDataSource.ipynb)

**Quick Start Jupyter Notebook Spark 4.0.x**: [PdfDataSourceSpark4.ipynb](https://github.com/StabRise/spark-pdf/blob/main/examples/PdfDataSourceSpark4.ipynb)

**Key Capabilities:**

 - **Effortless PDF Ingestion:** Read PDF documents directly into Spark DataFrames for efficient data processing and analysis.
 - **Optimized Performance:** Leverage lazy per-page reading to minimize memory consumption and maximize processing speed, even for large-scale datasets.
 - **Robust Support for Diverse PDF Formats:** Handle a wide range of PDF files, including those with extensive page counts (up to 10,000 pages).
 - **Enhanced OCR Functionality:** Extract text from scanned PDF documents with built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities.
 - **Simplified Setup:** Eliminate the need for external Tesseract OCR installations â€“ Tesseract OCR is conveniently included within the package.

## System Requirements:
 - **Java**: Java 8, 11, or 17
 - **Apache Spark**: 3.3.2, 3.4.1, 3.5.0, or 4.0.0 (Spark 4.0.0 support commences with version 0.1.11 and necessitates Java 17 and Scala 2.13)
 - **Ghostscript**: 9.50 or later (required exclusively for the Ghostscript reader)

## Installation:

The binary package is readily available within the Maven Central Repository. Utilize the following Maven coordinates, aligning with your specific Spark version:

 - __Spark 3.5.*__:com.stabrise:spark-pdf-spark35_2.12:0.1.11
 - __Spark 3.4.*__:com.stabrise:spark-pdf-spark34_2.12:0.1.11
 - __Spark 3.3.*__:com.stabrise:spark-pdf-spark33_2.12:0.1.11
 - __Spark 4.0.*__:com.stabrise:spark-pdf-spark34_2.13:0.1.11

## Contributing to the Project:

We encourage community involvement. If you find Spark PDF valuable, please consider showing your support by starring the project repository on GitHub.

## Conclusion:

Spark PDF significantly enhances the capabilities of Apache Spark by providing a robust and efficient mechanism for integrating PDF data into your data pipelines. This empowers data scientists, engineers, and analysts to unlock valuable insights from previously inaccessible PDF sources.
